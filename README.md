# LoRA Prompter

## Overview
The LoRA Prompter is a Python application designed to generate high-quality images using advanced generative models like Stable Diffusion and its variants. It uniquely incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) models to fine-tune and enhance the output quality. This application is user-friendly and packed with features such as prompt customization, long prompt handling, robust post-processing, and efficient cache management.

## Features

### 1. **Multiple Model Integration**
The LoRA Prompter supports various pre-configured models known for generating a wide range of artistic styles. Users can easily select from the list of available models, each with its specific settings. This flexibility allows you to create images that align precisely with your creative vision.

### 2. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) Model Support**
LoRA models are specialized to enhance specific aspects of the image generation process. The LoRA Prompter can load these LoRA models and append their trigger phrases to your input prompts. This integration allows for more nuanced and detailed image generation. Users can adjust the strength of these LoRA models to control their impact on the final output.

### 3. **Prompt and Negative Prompt Handling**
When running the application, users are asked to provide both a main prompt and a negative prompt. The main prompt describes what you want to create, while the negative prompt helps filter out undesired elements from generated images, thereby improving the overall quality and relevance of the results.

### 4. **Long Prompt Handling with Compel**
The Compel library helps manage prompt strings that exceed token limits. It parses these long prompts and builds conditioning tensors that ensure the entire input is considered during image generation. This feature is particularly useful for complex and detailed descriptions that might otherwise be truncated.

### 5. **Post-Processing with Pillow**
After generating an image, the application uses the Pillow library for post-processing. This includes resizing the image to enhance its resolution and applying filters to improve sharpness and contrast. These enhancements ensure that the final output is visually appealing and of high quality.

### 6. **Effective Cache Management**
Disk space management is crucial for applications dealing with large models and datasets. The LoRA Prompter checks the available disk space in the cache directory and deletes the oldest cached folders if necessary. This process helps maintain sufficient free space for new models and data.

### 7. **Device Setup and Optimization**
The application automatically detects the available hardware and optimizes its operations accordingly. If a GPU is available, it will leverage CUDA (a parallel computing platform) for faster processing. Otherwise, it will use the CPU. This optimization ensures efficient use of system resources.

### 8. **Flexible Configuration via Model Configs**
Configurations for each model are maintained in a separate file (`model_configs.py`). This setup allows for easy modifications and additions of new models without the need to alter the main application code.

### 9. **User Interaction and Feedback**
The application provides a user-friendly command line interface, prompting users for necessary inputs and giving detailed feedback on the applied settings and generation process. This interaction ensures that users are informed and in control throughout the entire process.

### 10. **Automatic Image Saving and Viewing**
Generated images are automatically saved in a specified directory with filenames based on a customizable template. Additionally, users have the option to open and view the images immediately after creation.
